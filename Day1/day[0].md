# Day 1: Introduction and Setup

Today marks the first step in this exciting journey. I've set up the HTB environment and begun exploring the learning modules. It's a new world of opportunities, and I'm thrilled to see where this path leads me.
Obviously with some of the topics i might and will be very familiar from software development but i don't mind that

- **Today's Achievement**: Successfully navigated through the introductory phase of Hack The Box.
  - Setting up the Virtual box environment and Kali Linux
- **Learnings**: Grasped the basics of the HTB environment, understanding how the learning modules operate and the potential they hold for growth and learning.
